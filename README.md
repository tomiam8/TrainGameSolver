# TrainGameSolver
I was bored. I made a thing. Here is that thing. TBH this probably should have been a gist, but whatever.
It solves the train game / sydney trains carriage game / IDK what it's called, but it's that game where you try to make the digists on your (sydney) train carriage add up to 10.
This solves it using only +-*/ in any order, but using brackets. It tends to find duplicates. (opps).
